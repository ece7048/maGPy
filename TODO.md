# TODO

## general
* check how the nugget should be used for prediction vs estimation with the posterior
* provide option to use a constant scalar mean
* save useful covariance-related matrices for faster posteriors

## history matching

## sensitivity
* do routines and plots make sense when not scaled into range 0 to 1 ?
* why is Pw\_calc called so many times if value doesn't change?
